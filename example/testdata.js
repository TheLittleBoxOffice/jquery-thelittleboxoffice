Brahms&rsquo; first song appeared in 1854. He was influenced by German folksong, where simplicity and stylisation embodies a quality of perfection. The main feature of the violin sonata is the beautiful singing quality expected from the violin, which takes the lead throughout, resulting in a genial warmth, freshness and charm. The clarinet sonata is one of two last works for concerted instruments that Brahms wrote in 1894 when he went to Frankfurt so that Clara Schumann and Joachim could hear them, and this was the last occasion on which these three devoted friends met together.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Sunday 12 October 3pm<br \/>\nTickets &nbsp;<\/strong>&pound;12 &nbsp;&pound;5 (under 15 years)","teaser":"Presented by Anne and Tony Rogers<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFantasies Op. 116 &ndash; Hilary Suckling (piano)<br \/>\nSelected Lieder &ndash; Caroline Luard (soprano) and Ingrid Attwater (piano)<br \/>\n<em>Interval<\/em><br \/>\nViolin Sonata No. 1 in G major Op. 78 &ndash; Olivia Ziani (violin)<br \/>\nand Hilary Suckling (piano)<br \/>\nClarinet Sonata No. 1 in F minor Op. 120 &ndash; Stephen Willis (clarinet) and Millan Sachania (piano)<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Fantasies contain some of the loveliest music ever written for the piano......<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Sunday 12 October 3pm<br \/>\nTickets &nbsp;<\/strong>&pound;12 &nbsp;&pound;5 (under 15 years)","venue_id":"12","performances":[{"id":"14901","start_date":"2014-10-12","start_time":"15:00:00","parent_event_id":"14900"}],"image_small":"https:\/\/thelittleboxoffice.com\/clients\/8\/cache\/Johannes_Brahms_old1__8__smail_thumbnail.jpg","image_large":"https:\/\/thelittleboxoffice.com\/clients\/8\/cache\/Johannes_Brahms_old1__8__thumbnail.jpg","categories":["23","46"],"link_base":"https:\/\/thelittleboxoffice.com\/riverhouse","link_book":"https:\/\/thelittleboxoffice.com\/riverhouse\/book\/event\/14900","link_view":"https:\/\/thelittleboxoffice.com\/riverhouse\/event\/view\/14900"},{"id":"14587","image":"cocos_lovers_x_6.JPG","title":"Cocos Lovers + Hot Feet (support)","body":"Operating well beyond the remit of alt-&shy;folk, Cocos Lovers (pronounced Co-&shy;Coss) are a distinctive musical force, seamlessly channelling influences from Africa, the US Deep South and several other real and imagined corners of the globe, while staying ever faithful to their Kentish roots.

Upon delivery, the owner thought it was not Victorian, as advertised, but Tudor and thus exceptionally rare. In January 2013 Dr Jonathan Foyle examined it and began researching in depth its puzzling symbolism and old surfaces. Over the course of 16 months it revealed its astonishing origin - as the marriage bed of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, made for their marriage on 18 January 1486. Its importance is immense - it is the only surviving medieval royal bed and the sole manifestation of the ambitions of the new dynasty. This is the historical find of a lifetime.
